      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This app was made from the Hate Symbols Database maintained by the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL fights all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact. A global leader in combating antisemitism, countering extremism and battling bigotry wherever and whenever it happens, ADL works to protect democracy and ensure a just and inclusive society for all.</p>
      <p>As a patriotic antifascist, I feel it is my duty to educate and inspire my country to recognize the threat posed by white supremacist ideology and organizations. Use this app as a tool to quickly recognize the signs & symbols of increasingly bold hate-groups. You may be unpleasantly surprised how many are present in plain view on any given day.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately the data from ADL is a little outdated and far from complete. This list does not contain any references to Q-Anon, Stop The Steal, or other MAGA conspiracies. Nor does it mention Proud Boys, 3%ers, Patriot Front or any modern militia movements. Care must be taken to quantify and label these organizations.</p>
